# js2-course-assignment

In this project the goal was to create a blog. I chose to not do a theme, as i wanted it to be open and for the user to be able to create posts regarding whatever they wanted to. 

I managed to push some of my earlier changes to the main branch early, and did not leave the full pr open. When i realized my mistake i contacted Oliver Dipple, and he asked me to include the mistake in this file, and just have an open PR from now on.
